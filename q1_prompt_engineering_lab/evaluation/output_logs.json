    "output": "High Blood Sugar:\n\nHigh blood sugar, also known as hyperglycemia, occurs when the glucose (sugar) level in your bloodstream is higher than normal. The human body has a mechanism to regulate blood sugar levels by producing insulin, which helps cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream and use it for energy.\n\nThe following are common symptoms of high blood sugar:\n1. Frequent urination: Your kidneys work harder when there's too much glucose in the bloodstream, leading to increased urine production.\n2. Extreme thirst: This is often a result of frequent urination.\n3. Increased hunger: The body struggles to use insulin effectively for energy, leading to constant feelings of hunger.\n4. Weight loss and fatigue: Despite eating more than usual, you may experience weight loss due to inefficient glucose uptake by cells, causing extreme tiredness.\n5. Blurred vision: High blood sugar levels can affect the lens' ability to adjust to light changes, resulting in blurred vision.\n\nThe treatment for high blood sugar includes dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and medical supervision, as per a healthcare provider's guidance. In some cases, medications or insulin therapy might be required depending on severity and underlying causes.\n\nDengue:\n\nDengue is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito (Aedes species), primarily in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. It does not present with symptoms of high blood sugar such as frequent urination or extreme thirst, but instead features its own set of symptoms related to dengue fever.\n\nCommon symptoms of dengue include:\n1. High fever: A temperature often reaching over 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C)\n2. Severe headache\n3. Severe pain behind the eyes\n4. Joint and muscle pain (\"breakbone fever\")\n5. Nausea, vomiting\n6.
