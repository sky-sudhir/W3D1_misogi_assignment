        "Step 1: Represent the statements using set theory. 'All Bloops are Razzies' means the set of Bloops is a subset of the set of Razzies.  Step 2: Similarly, 'All Razzies are Lazzies' means the set of Razzies is a subset of the set of Lazzies. Step 3: If set A is a subset of set B, and set B is a subset of set C, then set A must be a subset of set C. Step 4: Therefore, the set of Bloops is a subset of the set of Lazzies. Step 5: This means all Bloops are Lazzies."

Step 3: 'All Razzies are Lazzies' means all mammals are Lazzies. Step 4: Therefore, all dogs are Lazzies. Step 5: Since Bloops are dogs in this example, all Bloops are Lazzies.

Step 3: 'All Razzies are Lazzies' can be written as: If R, then L (R -> L). Step 4: We are asked if 'All Bloops are Lazzies' is definitely true, which would be: If B, then L (B -> L).
