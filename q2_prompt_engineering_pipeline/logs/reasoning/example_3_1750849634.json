        "Step 1: Represent the statements using set theory. 'All Bloops are Razzies' means the set of Bloops is a subset of the set of Razzies. Step 2: Similarly, 'All Razzies are Lazzies' means the set of Razzies is a subset of the set of Lazzies. Step 3: If set A is a subset of set B, and set B is a subset of set C, then set A is a subset of set C. Step 4: Therefore, the set of Bloops is a subset of the set of Lazzies. Step 5: This means all Bloops are Lazzies."

Step 2: Since all Bloops are Razzies, draw the Bloops circle entirely inside the Razzies circle. Step 3: Since all Razzies are Lazzies, draw the Razzies circle entirely inside the Lazzies circle.
